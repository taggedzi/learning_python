# learning_python
This repo is dedicated to retaining program files, which are samples of concepts, and notes about programing concepts in the Python Programming language.

This repository will become a collection of notes from the various classes I've taken, youtube video's watched, documents and books read. All demonstrating or explaining aspects of the Python Programming language.

I will try to break it into
* Attributes of the language 'attributes'
* Programming theory 'theory'
* Programming examples 'examples'

I will try to also break the folders down in some logical way, but I reserver the right to change it at any time.
